# My-Interview-Preparation
I have prepared comprehensive documents for Java interview preparation, along with detailed notes that cover both core Java and advanced frameworks. These materials are structured to provide clarity on essential topics such as object-oriented programming, collections, multithreading, exception handling, and Java 8+ features. In addition, I have included in-depth coverage of Spring Core concepts like dependency injection, inversion of control, bean lifecycle, and application context, as well as practical insights into Spring Boot for building and deploying microservices with ease. The notes also highlight commonly asked interview questions, best practices, and real-world examples, making them a valuable resource not only for interview readiness but also for strengthening day-to-day backend development skills.
